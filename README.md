# Chat App

A simple app to test realtime push in a simple chat app using pusher.com services.

The app was created using Rails and React because those were the tools we have in a larger project in which I hope to create a similar effect.

The app is straightforward. If you type a message in, it will return your message (without a refresh) with some added text. The app really shows it's functionality if you open two browsers. Type the message in one browser and it will appear in the other browser.
